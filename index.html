            <p>An Arcade-style video game is one that is designed following the basic principles of the old games for
                Arcade machines. Its main features are a simple design and easy to assimilate controls, short and
                ascending levels of difficulty and minimal interruption between levels.
                These features were originally used to keep players in the game for a short time so that they would soon
                have to insert more credits into the machine to challenge it again.</p>

            <p>In this way, the term "Arcade" no longer designates video game machines for living rooms, but it is also
                a term that is used as a genre of video games to classify games that have these distinctive
                characteristics.
                The term Arcade can also be found as a very common game mode in action games for consoles.</p>

            <p>Galaxy Game, programmed by Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, is the first commercial game on record. It was
                installed at Stanford University in September 1971,
                two months before the launch of Computer Space. At first only one machine was created,
                although later some more would be manufactured and the game would be adapted to a multitude of home
                systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                A year later Atari was released with the PONG arcade. Nolan Bushnell located the first machine at a
                local gas station and when he saw how it had gone,
                the machine was no longer working. It was completely full of coins.
                Unlike Computer Space, the PONG had a very simple handling and everyone could play and have fun from the
                first game.

                <p>Digital marketing is the component of marketing that utilizes internet and online based digital
                    technologies such as desktop computers,
                    mobile phones and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services.Its development
                    during the 1990s and 2000s,
                    changed the way brands and businesses use technology for marketing. As digital platforms became
                    increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life,
                    and as people increasingly use digital devices instead of visiting physical shops,digital marketing
                    campaigns have become prevalent.

                    The programming is the process used to design and order the necessary actions to carry out a
                    project, prepare certain machinery for starting work at the time and in the
                    desired shape or develop programs for use in computers.

                    Currently, the notion of programming is closely associated with the creation of computer
                    applications and video games .It is the process by which a person develops a
                    program using a tool that allows him to write the code (which can be in one or more languages,
                    such as C ++, Java and Python, among others) and another that is capable of "translate it "into what
                    is known as machine language, which can be understood by
                    microprocessor.

                    A video game is an electronic game in which one or more people interact, through a controller, with
                    a device that displays video images.
                    This electronic device, known generically as a platform, can be a computer , an arcade machine,
                    a game console, or a portable device, such as a mobile phone . Video games are, year by year, one of
                    the main industries of art and entertainment.

                    The input device, used to manipulate a video game is known as a video game controller, or
                    controller, and varies depending on the platform.For example,
                    one controller could only consist of a button and a joystick or joystick, while another could have a
                    dozen buttons and one or more levers.
